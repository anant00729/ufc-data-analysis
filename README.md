## UFC Data Analysis
This is a list of every UFC fight in the history of the organisation. Every row contains information about both fighters, fight details and the winner. The data was scraped from ufcstats website. 

The data is scraped from 
["ufcstats.com"](http://www.ufcstats.com/).

## Scraping module
I used beautifulsoup to scrape the data and pandas to process it.
This is my first time creating a dataset, any suggestions and corrections are welcome! Incase anyone wants to check out the work, I have all uploaded all the code files, including the scraping module
[here](https://github.com/anant00729/ufc-data-analysis/tree/master/scraping).
